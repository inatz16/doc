[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is supported by continuousphp. It uses the [official MariaDB Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/).

## Specification

MariaDB containers are available for each activity in your build. To enable one of them, simply add the environment
variable `CPHP_SERVICE_MARIADB` with the desired MariaDB version as value to your pipeline configuration. Available versions are :

* ***10.3.2***

E.g. if you need `MariaDB 10.3.2` in your Behat tests, go to the Testing Settings (step 2 of the Pipeline) and add the
environment variable `CPHP_SERVICE_MARIADB = 5.7.20` to the Behat configuration.

### PHP Extensions

Our containers implement the following PHP extensions for MariaDB :

* mysql
* mysqli
* mysqlnd
* pdo_mysql
